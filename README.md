# NebGov

**Permissionless on-chain governance for every Soroban protocol.**

NebGov is the canonical governance framework for the Stellar ecosystem — a modular, auditable, and composable set of smart contracts that any Soroban protocol can plug into to add on-chain governance.

| Token-weighted voting | Snapshot voting power from any SEP-41 token |
| Delegation | Delegate voting power to any address |
| Multi-sig treasury | DAO-controlled treasury with configurable threshold |
| Permissionless factory | Deploy your own governance instance in one call |

## Quick Start

Get started by deploying your first NebGov DAO to the Stellar testnet in under 10 minutes:

👉 **[Deploy your first DAO on Stellar with NebGov](./docs/tutorial.md)**

### Local development stack (Docker)

Bring up Postgres + indexer + backend + app with one command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set GOVENOR_ADDRESS in .env (required)
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

- App: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend health: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Indexer health: `http://localhost:3002/health`

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the full design overview.

## Production Deployment Guides

- [docs/parameter-guide.md](./docs/parameter-guide.md) — safe governance parameter ranges and preset configurations
- [docs/security.md](./docs/security.md) — treasury reentrancy analysis and contract security notes

```
propose() → Governor → [voting period] → queue() → Timelock → execute()
