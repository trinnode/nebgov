# Contributing to NebGov

Thank you for contributing to NebGov, the permissionless governance framework for Stellar.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable toolchain) with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- **Stellar CLI** (`stellar`) for contract building and testing
- **Node.js 20+** with **pnpm 9+**
- **Git**

### Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli

# Node.js (via nvm)
nvm install 20
npm install -g pnpm@9
```

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nebgov/nebgov && cd nebgov

# Build all Soroban contracts
stellar contract build

# Install JS dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the SDK
pnpm build:sdk
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Rust contract tests
cargo test --workspace

# SDK unit tests
pnpm test:sdk

# Frontend tests
pnpm test:app

# E2E tests (requires running app)
cd app && npx playwright test
```

## Security Scanning

We use [CoinFabrik Scout](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout) to automatically scan our Soroban contracts for security vulnerabilities.

### Local Usage

To run Scout locally, you first need to install the `scout-audit` tool:

```bash
cargo install cargo-scout-audit
```

Then, run the scanner from the repository root:

```bash
cargo scout-audit --output-format html
```

This will generate an `audit_report.html` file with the results.

### Interpreting Results

- **Critical/High**: These findings will fail the CI build and **must** be addressed before merging.
- **Medium/Low/Info**: These findings do not fail the CI but should be reviewed and fixed if applicable.

### Suppressing False Positives

If a finding is confirmed as a false positive, it can be suppressed in `.scout.toml` at the repository root. Each suppression must include a justification:

```toml
[[suppressions]]
detector = "detector_name"
reason = "Suppressed: [reason] — [date] — [author]"
```

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find an issue

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/nebgov/nebgov/issues). Each issue is tagged with:
- `complexity: trivial` - small, well-scoped change
- `complexity: medium` - moderate implementation work
- `complexity: high` - significant feature or architectural change

Issues tagged `good first issue` are recommended for first-time contributors.

## Branch Naming

- `feat/issue-<number>-<description>` for features
- `fix/issue-<number>-<description>` for bug fixes
- `docs/issue-<number>-<description>` for documentation

## Commit Messages

Use imperative mood with conventional prefixes:
- `feat: add vote delegation`
- `fix: correct quorum calculation`
- `docs: update architecture diagram`
- `test: add governor edge cases`
- `chore: update dependencies`

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with tests for new features
3. Ensure all CI checks pass: `cargo test --workspace && pnpm test:sdk`
4. Update docs if you changed any public API
5. Open a PR referencing the issue: `Closes #<number>`
6. Wait for maintainer review. Note that reviewers are automatically assigned based on our [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) configuration. For more details on our branch protection rules, see [Branch Protection](docs/contributing/branch-protection.md).

## Code Standards

### Rust (contracts)
- Format with `cargo fmt`
- No `unsafe` code
- All public functions must have doc comments
- Tests live in `#[cfg(test)]` modules

### TypeScript (SDK + frontend)
- Strict TypeScript, no `any` types
- Run `pnpm lint` before pushing
- Use named exports

## Issue Scope

Each issue is scoped to be completable in **under one week** by a single contributor. If you find an issue is larger than expected, comment on it so it can be split.
